<div><div><div><div><p>I'm Jasmin, and I'm from Germany. I have always had an intense curiosity for learning, especially regarding human behavior. As a child of a German mother and an Indonesian-Chinese father, I found myself curious about what characteristics of my father were his personality and which were shaped by culture. I started out learning the Chinese language because I wanted to understand the culture and people. I hold a Master's Degree in Sinology from Goethe University Frankfurt. During my studies, I lived for one year in Peking (China) and traveled extensively in Southeast Asia. To finance my travels, I worked in several HR departments like Ceva Logistics and Vattenfall Hamburg during my studies. Knowing that these experiences are unique, I have grasped every opportunity to explore culture on a deeper level. Traveling and encountering so many different people really helped me grow as a person. It broadened my perspective of how different people can behave and see the world and also what most people have in common, such as seeking connections.</p>

<p>When I finished my studies, my curiosity shifted toward people's behavior in my working environment. So I started looking for jobs in this field and found a job at Plan International Germany. I loved my work when I started in HR. I was curious about what was happening behind the scenes of an organization and enjoyed working for an employer pursuing a noble purpose. I got to know so many people who want to make the world a better place. But working behind the scenes of two big NGOs made me feel like helping others do meaningful work while I stood on the sidelines watching. At the same time, I observed that as an organization extensively grows, the higher the need for digitalization.

<h2> Why UX Design </h2>
<p>After a career break to support my family, I was in search of a new challenge. As part of my previous role, I worked closely with employees to understand their needs and concerns. Consequently, I understand very well what motivates and frustrates employees. I've always been a hands-on person who likes to see the impact of my work. At some point in my previous job, I felt like having a minimal effect on my work output. There were more and more factors that I couldn't influence in my position and, at the same time, significantly impacted my work.I sought a job that would be in demand even in the upcoming years. I thought about areas that have a huge demand and are appealing to me. As a recruiter, I saw the most substantial demand in IT. I also realized that women were underrepresented when it came to technology. So I started looking for jobs in IT without the coding skills required. I quickly stumbled upon UX Design</p>

<p>What strongly resonates with me about UX Design is the approach of understanding people and the creative process to solve problems and create products and services that people love. I also realized that the core competencies I had as a HR manager were relevant to a User Experience Designer. This involves empathy, understanding and designing the user experience. Because of my work in Human Resources, I developed those skills and transferred them into UX Design. As a result, my HR experience benefited when I transitioned to UX Design.What I also appreciate is the openminded and supportive Design community. Till today there’s so much that ignite my curiosity and willingness to learn, when it comes to UX.
</p>

<p>I am well equipped with various skills, such as conducting research, interviewing people, and problem-solving. I can work independently and in a team. My excellent analytical skills help me identify user needs and pain points. My organizational skills are also helpful in managing projects and ensuring that deadlines are met. In addition, my communication skills allow me to effectively present my ideas to clients and colleagues. Overall, my diverse background has given me the skills and knowledge I need to succeed as a UX designer. I strongly believe that the most valuable component of any relationship is trust and honesty. I’m currently looking for a company that shares this belief and gives me enough freedom to learn and grow as a UX Designer. Since I don't want to move, I am open to remote jobs as well as hybrid jobs as long as travel frequency and distance are reasonable.</p></div></div></div></div>
