<div><div><div><div><p>I'm Jasmin, and I'm from Germany. When Corona started in 2020, I moved with my family back to my hometown Iserlohn, where I currently live – it's a town famous for its woods to wander. As my father is Indonesian-Chinese I developed a strong curiosity for Asian Culture. In 2004 I started studying Chinese Culture and Language at university. During my studies I was focused on learning Chinese language, research and writing. Whenever possible I travelled a lot with my backpack in Southeast Asia. I lived about one year in Peking, China, and six months on the island of gods, Bali.

<p>Knowing that these experiences are unique and that not everyone on earth has the opportunities I have, I have grasped every opportunity to explore culture on a deeper level. I like to explore new cultures and learn about different ways of life; it just comes naturally to me. Traveling and encountering so many different people really helped me grow as a person. It broadened my perspective of how different people can behave and see the world and also what most people have in common, such as seeking connections.</p>

<p>After graduating I worked for 8 years in Human Resources with different Humanitarian Organizations. I loved my work when I started in HR. I liked working for an organization that seemed to have a clear purpose. Working in these organizations raised my awareness of equality as well as accessibility. I got lucky to get to know so many people who want to make the world a better place. But it also made me feel like helping others do meaningful work while I stood on the sidelines watching.</p>

<p>After a career break to support my family, I was in search of a new challenge. I wanted to learn something out of nothing, get creative and work flexible hours. I wondered which department would meet my criteria and I concluded that perhaps the IT department was the right one. At first, I thought I don’t know how somebody with my skill set might fit in, but from my experience nowadays there are a hundred jobs, you don’t know about and might be a good fit. So I started looking for jobs in IT without the coding skills required. I happened upon UX Design. I researched what the role entailed and what type of person would be successful in the field and voila: I was subscribed to a 10-month program as UX Designer at Careerfoundry.</p>

<p>As part of my previous role, I worked closely with employees to understand their needs and concerns. Consequently, I understand very well what motivates and frustrates employees. I also realized that the core competencies I had as a HR manager were relevant to a User Experience Designer. This involves empathy, understanding and designing the user experience. Because of my work in Human Resources, I developed those skills and transferred them into UX Design. As a result, my HR experience benefited when I transitioned to UX Design.</p>

<p>I am well equipped with various skills, such as conducting research, interviewing people, and problem-solving. I can work independently and in a team. My excellent analytical skills help me identify user needs and pain points. My organizational skills are also helpful in managing projects and ensuring that deadlines are met. In addition, my communication skills allow me to effectively present my ideas to clients and colleagues. Overall, my diverse background has given me the skills and knowledge I need to succeed as a UX designer. I strongly believe that the most valuable component of any relationship is trust and honesty. I’m currently looking for a company that shares this belief and gives me enough freedom to learn and grow as a UX Designer. Since I don't want to move, I am open to remote jobs as well as hybrid jobs as long as travel frequency and distance are reasonable.</p></div></div></div></div>
