      <p>
Since my parents have been self-employed most of their lives, the main topic on the family table was: How to grow the family business? From my parent's experience, I know designing a company is challenging. It comprises the steady and rocky way of trial and error since you reach a product or service your customers love.  At the beginning of twenty, I was more fascinated by what was going on in people's minds, and I figured out that language was one way to get this insight. Since my father was Indonesian-Chinese, I decided to learn about the Chinese language and culture. I traveled a lot with my backpack in Southeast Asia during my studies. Traveling and encountering so many different people helped me grow as a person. It broadened my perspective of how other people can behave and see the world and what most people have in common, such as seeking connections.<br><br>
After graduating from university, I worked as an HR professional for an NGO in Hamburg. When I started my work, the company's recruiting revealed some shortcomings. The job ads were poorly designed, and the recruiting processes took forever, so candidates often decided to work elsewhere. In short, getting people to work for us was a challenge. I was lucky to have an employer who gave me a lot of freedom and let me try things out. I talked to people, learned about their pain points, and aligned processes and documents to their needs. By doing this, onboarding and recruiting soon became smooth experiences. Attracting qualified candidates became a problem of the past.  (Except for one department - IT) I enjoyed seeing the output of my work. When I look back on this development, it was probably the start of my career as a UX Designer.<br><br>

Later the events of Corona made me aware of how essential and, at the same time, how inadequate the digital infrastructure in Germany is. This topic aroused my curiosity, and I began to dig deeper into this field. I discovered that there were a lot of biases when it came to the area of computers. Like it's a field that only attracts men. I learned that one of the first programmers was a woman called Ada Lovelace. After a family break, I decided to look for potential jobs in this field. I created a set of criteria I wanted my dream job to entail. I wanted a job that would still allow me to connect with people on a deeper level, work creatively and provide flexibility. Since then, my learning has been an adventure I don't want to miss. I live in my hometown Iserlohn (Northrhine-Westfalia, Germany) again. Now I'm looking for an employer who allows me to put my skills into practice.
